## Simplified 3-Minute Pitch

### HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)
> "Thousands of hackathons and grants offer millions in prizes every year. But most developers miss out — not because they lack talent, but because they can't find them.
>
> We're Waxis, from Cornell and UofT. We built **OpportunityRadar**."

### PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:35)
> "Developers spend 10+ hours weekly searching across different platforms. Information is scattered. Deadlines are missed. Applications go to wrong-fit opportunities.
>
> Result? **70% of qualified developers never apply** to opportunities that could change their careers."

### SOLUTION (0:35 - 1:20)
> "OpportunityRadar solves this in four ways:
>
> **One, Smart Discovery** — 500+ sources, real-time updates, one platform.
>
> **Two, Intelligent Matching** — AI scores opportunities by relevance, eligibility, and timeline fit.
>
> **Three, AI Material Generation** — One click generates READMEs, pitch scripts, Q&A prep — tailored to judging criteria.
>
> **Four, Pipeline Tracking** — Kanban management plus calendar alerts. Never miss a deadline."

### TRACTION (1:20 - 1:35)
> "Our MVP is live. We've aggregated over **1,000 active opportunities**, and our matching algorithm achieves **86% accuracy**. Early users have cut their prep time from 40 hours down to 8 — that's a **5x improvement**."

### BUSINESS MODEL (1:35 - 1:55)
> "We offer a free tier with 3 matches per week. Pro at $19 per month gives you unlimited matching and AI-generated materials. Team at $49 per month adds collaboration features. And we have enterprise plans for universities and accelerators."

### MARKET (1:55 - 2:10)
> "There are over 50 million developers worldwide, more than 10,000 hackathons every year, and $50 billion in grants. Yet no unified platform serves this need — we're building the **LinkedIn for opportunities**."

### TEAM (2:10 - 2:25)
> "We're a team from Cornell and UofT. We've participated in dozens of hackathons and lived this problem firsthand. We built this MVP in 4 weeks, and we're ready to scale."

### CLOSE (2:25 - 2:45)
> "We believe every developer deserves access to growth opportunities — regardless of their background.
>
> **Discover. Match. Win.**
>
> We're OpportunityRadar. Thank you."
